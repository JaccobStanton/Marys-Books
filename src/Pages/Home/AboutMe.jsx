            " Born in St Louis, 1969. I am the middle child of 5. I grew up
            mostly in central illinois but graduated high school in Arcadia, MO.
            From there, I attended community college in St. Louis and in
            Decatur, Illinois focusing on graphic design and elementary
            education. I love art, music, the outdoors, bird watching, camping,
            and my family among other things. I married my husband Brian in 1996
            after which we bought our first home in 1996 as well.

            My amazing daughter was born in 1998 and then my brave son in 2000.
            I worked as a retail merchandise buying assistant for almost 13
            years before having to quit work and care for Brodin who had been
            diagnosed with Medulloblastoma at age 2. Our family learned to
            adjust to a medically sensitive child and extreme treatment
            protocols. Torn between hospitals in St. Louis and our home in
            illinois it was quite challenging. As treatment ended and Brodin
            recovered, so did our family. We learned to be brave individually in
            different ways.{" "}
          </p>

          <p className="hero--section-description">
            As a result of Brodins medical history, he was now special needs
            with cognitive impairment, speech impairment, hearing impaired,
            multiple physical needs as well as behaviorally challenging. Once
            again our family was challenged with new concerns. Once again, we
            conquered and embraced our future. I then spent many years
            dedicating my career to working with special needs kids in the
            school setting. "
